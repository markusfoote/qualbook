MRI is a good candidate for CS because the image is naturally formed in a sparse frequency domain. The trivial inverse Fourier transform reconstruction of a sub-sampled, sparse frequency domain causes significant image artifacts. To decrease these artifacts, a penalty is applied to impose smoothness on the image. Depending on the smoothness penalty, it may also impose fullness on the sub-sampled frequency domain.
