# PhD Qualifing Exam Study Document README #
This repository is a summary of expected questions and responses for the 2017 Bioenginering Image Track PhD Qualifying Exam. The .tex files compile to a (hopefully) nice looking document to read. The root document is all.tex
Use of the TeXLive 2017+ distribution is recommended for compilation. The authors use TeXstudio for editing.
